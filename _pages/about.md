I am a computer engineer specialized in full-stack development and computer vision practices. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio with hands-on experience deploying user-friendly web applications that utilize advanced deep learning and image analysis methods. My professional experience is mainly in developing solutions within a collaborative research setting, but I intend to branch out and develop impactful applications for broader user-bases.
