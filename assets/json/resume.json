      "summary": "Introduction: Advancements in machine learning (ML) algorithms that make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed and the increased computational speeds of graphics processing units (GPUs) over the last decade have led to remarkable progress in the capabilities of ML. In many fields, including agriculture, this progress has outpaced the availability of sufficiently diverse and high-quality datasets, which now serve as a limiting factor. While many agricultural use cases appear feasible with current compute resources and ML algorithms, the lack of reusable hardware and software components, referred to as cyberinfrastructure (CI), for collecting, transmitting, cleaning, labeling, and training datasets is a major hindrance toward developing solutions to address agricultural use cases. This study focuses on addressing these challenges by exploring the collection, processing, and training of ML models using a multimodal dataset and providing a vision for agriculture-focused CI to accelerate innovation in the field."
